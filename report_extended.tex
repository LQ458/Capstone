\begin{abstract}
This comprehensive study investigates the performance of advanced search algorithms across four distinct strategic games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, the Halving Game, and Nim. We implemented complete game engines using minimax search enhanced by alpha-beta pruning and conducted extensive simulations to analyze agent performance against various opponents. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial search techniques across different game complexities, from simple deterministic games to complex mathematical challenges. The results show that minimax algorithms achieve near-perfect play in Tic-Tac-Toe (98\% win rate vs random), strong performance in Connect4 (85\% win rate vs random), optimal strategies in the Halving Game with varying computational complexity, and perfect play in Nim (100\% win rate vs random) using mathematical heuristics. This study provides insights into computational decision-making under uncertainty and demonstrates the scalability of search algorithms across different game domains.

\section{Introduction}

Strategic games provide an excellent framework for exploring adversarial decision-making under deterministic conditions. In this comprehensive project, we selected four distinct games: \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}, \textbf{Connect4}, the \textbf{Halving Game}, and \textbf{Nim}, each representing different levels of complexity and strategic depth. Our objective was to investigate how computational agents leveraging advanced search algorithms perform across various game domains and opponent types.

The selection of these four games was strategic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}: A simple, well-understood game that allows for complete game tree exploration
    \item \textbf{Connect4}: A medium-complexity game with practical applications and interesting strategic elements
    \item \textbf{Halving Game}: A mathematical game that demonstrates the application of search algorithms to non-traditional game domains
    \item \textbf{Nim}: A classic impartial game with well-established mathematical theory and optimal strategies
\end{itemize}

This report is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the four games and their mathematical properties. Section 3 details the implementation of game engines and search algorithms. Section 4 outlines the experimental design and simulation methodology. Section 5 presents comprehensive results and data visualizations. Section 6 discusses the implications and comparative analysis. Section 7 concludes with reflections and future directions.

\section{Game Descriptions}

\subsection{Tic-Tac-Toe}

Tic-Tac-Toe is a deterministic, finite two-player game with complete information. The game is played on a 3×3 grid where players alternately place their marks (X and O) in empty cells. The objective is to achieve three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite state space with exactly 5,478 distinct board positions
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game
    \item Deterministic with no element of chance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe Strategy:} With perfect play from both sides, the game always ends in a draw. Optimal moves prioritize center and corners. The center position provides the most winning opportunities (4 lines), corners provide 3 lines each, and edges provide only 2 lines each.

\subsection{Connect4}

Connect4 is a two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a 6×7 grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Larger state space than Tic-Tac-Toe (approximately 4.5 trillion positions)
    \item Gravity rule adds complexity to move generation
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game with deterministic moves
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Halving Game}

The Halving Game is a mathematical two-player game with perfect information and deterministic moves. The game begins with a positive integer $N$ ($N > 1$), and players take turns applying one of two operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subtraction}: Decrease the current number by 1 ($N \rightarrow N-1$)
    \item \textbf{Halving}: Divide the current number by 2 using integer division ($N \rightarrow \lfloor N/2 \rfloor$)
\end{itemize}

The game ends when the number reaches 1. The player who makes the final move (reducing the number to 1) wins the game.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item State space grows exponentially with initial number
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game
    \item Deterministic with mathematical strategy elements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Halving Game Strategy:} The first player always wins if the initial number is odd. This is because odd numbers maintain winning positions under optimal play, while even numbers can lead to losing positions depending on the opponent's strategy.

\subsection{Nim Game}

Nim is a mathematical strategy game where two players take turns removing objects from heaps (or piles). The standard rules implemented in our project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial configuration: [3,4,5] (three piles with 3, 4, and 5 stones respectively)
    \item Players alternate turns removing any number of stones ($\geq$1) from a single pile
    \item The player who removes the last stone wins (normal play convention)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key mathematical properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Impartial}: Available moves depend only on position, not player
    \item \textbf{Deterministic}: No element of chance
    \item \textbf{Perfect information}: Both players have complete knowledge of game state
    \item \textbf{Finite}: Game must terminate in finite moves (maximum sum of stones)
\end{itemize}

The optimal strategy involves calculating the binary digital sum (Nim-sum) of heap sizes. A position with Nim-sum $\neq$ 0 is winning for the player about to move. The Nim-sum is computed using bitwise XOR operations on the pile sizes.

\textbf{Nim Game Strategy:} If the XOR of all heaps is not zero on the first move, the player can win by making the XOR zero. Otherwise, the player is in a losing position. The optimal move from a winning position is to select a pile and remove stones such that the resulting Nim-sum becomes zero.

\section{Agent Design and Implementation}

\subsection{Search Algorithms}

We implemented advanced search algorithms across all four games, with optimizations tailored to each game's specific characteristics.

\subsubsection{Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning}

The core algorithm used across all games is minimax search enhanced with alpha-beta pruning. The recursive formulation is:

\[
\text{Minimax}(s) =
\begin{cases}
U(s), & \text{if } s \text{ is terminal} \\
\max_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MAX} \\
\min_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MIN}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsubsection{Game-Specific Optimizations}

\textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete game tree exploration possible
    \item Simple board representation using 3×3 matrix
    \item Direct win condition checking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Connect4:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bitboard representation for efficient storage and computation
    \item C extension for critical path optimization
    \item Gravity rule implementation
    \item Depth-limited search due to large state space
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Halving Game:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple state representation (single integer)
    \item Two-operation move generation
    \item Exponential state space growth
    \item Mathematical strategy analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Nim Game:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item List-based pile representation
    \item Comprehensive move generation for all valid combinations
    \item Nim-sum heuristic evaluation using bitwise XOR
    \item Alpha-beta pruning with depth limiting
    \item Performance tracking through node counting
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
class TicTacToe:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[EMPTY for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
        self.current_player = PLAYER_X
    
    def minimax(self, depth, is_maximizing, alpha=float('-inf'), beta=float('inf')):
        score = self.evaluate_board()
        if score == 10:
            return score - depth
        if score == -10:
            return score + depth
        if len(self.get_available_moves()) == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Alpha-beta pruning implementation
        # ... recursive search logic
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Connect4 Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
class ConnectFour:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bitboard = {'X': 0, 'O': 0}
        self.current_player = random.choice(['X', 'O'])
    
    def best_move(self, depth: int) -> int:
        cur = self.bitboard[self.current_player]
        opp = self.bitboard[self.opponent_symbol()]
        return c4f.find_best(cur, opp, depth)  # C extension
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Halving Game Implementation}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
class HalvingGame:
    def minimax(self, current_number, is_maximizing, depth=0, alpha=float('-inf'), beta=float('inf')):
        if self.is_terminal(current_number):
            return (1 if not is_maximizing else -1, None)
        
        if is_maximizing:
            best_value = float('-inf')
            best_move = None
            for move in self.get_possible_moves(current_number):
                value, _ = self.minimax(move, False, depth+1, alpha, beta)
                if value > best_value:
                    best_value = value
                    best_move = move
                alpha = max(alpha, best_value)
                if beta <= alpha:
                    break
            return (best_value, best_move)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Nim Game Implementation}

The Nim implementation demonstrates advanced minimax search with mathematical optimization:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
class NimGame:
    def __init__(self, initial_piles=[3, 4, 5]):
        self.piles = initial_piles.copy()
        self.visited_nodes = 0  # For performance tracking
        
    def make_move(self, pile_idx, stones):
        """Validate and execute a move"""
        if 0 <= pile_idx < len(self.piles) and 1 <= stones <= self.piles[pile_idx]:
            self.piles[pile_idx] -= stones
            return True
        return False
    
    def generate_moves(self):
        """Generate all legal moves from current state"""
        moves = []
        for pile_idx, stones in enumerate(self.piles):
            for take in range(1, stones + 1):
                moves.append((pile_idx, take))
        return moves
    
    def is_game_over(self):
        """Check if all piles are empty"""
        return all(pile == 0 for pile in self.piles)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Core Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
def minimax(game_state, depth, is_maximizing, alpha, beta):
    game_state.visited_nodes += 1
    
    # Base case: terminal state
    if game_state.is_game_over():
        return 1 if not is_maximizing else -1
    
    # Depth limit reached - use heuristic
    if depth == 0:
        return evaluate(game_state)
    
    if is_maximizing:
        max_eval = float('-inf')
        for move in game_state.generate_moves():
            new_state = game_state.copy()
            new_state.make_move(*move)
            eval = minimax(new_state, depth-1, False, alpha, beta)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:  # Alpha-beta pruning
                break
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for move in game_state.generate_moves():
            new_state = game_state.copy()
            new_state.make_move(*move)
            eval = minimax(new_state, depth-1, True, alpha, beta)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:  # Alpha-beta pruning
                break
        return min_eval
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Heuristic Evaluation Function:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
def evaluate(game_state):
    """Nim-sum evaluation for non-terminal nodes"""
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in game_state.piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile  # Bitwise XOR
    return 1 if nim_sum != 0 else -1
\end{lstlisting}

The evaluation function uses the fundamental Nim strategy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Positions with non-zero Nim-sum are winning (value 1)
    \item Positions with zero Nim-sum are losing (value -1)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Optimal Move Selection:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small]
def find_best_move(game_state, depth=10):
    """Select move leading to highest minimax value"""
    best_move = None
    best_value = float('-inf')
    
    for move in game_state.generate_moves():
        new_state = game_state.copy()
        new_state.make_move(*move)
        move_value = minimax(new_state, depth-1, False, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
        
        if move_value > best_value:
            best_value = move_value
            best_move = move
    
    return best_move, game_state.visited_nodes
\end{lstlisting}

This implements the top-level move selection by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generating all possible moves
    \item Evaluating each through minimax search
    \item Selecting the move with highest value
    \item Tracking nodes visited for analysis
