\begin{abstract}
This comprehensive study investigates the performance of advanced search algorithms across four distinct strategic games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, the Halving Game, and Nim. We implemented complete game engines using minimax search enhanced by alpha-beta pruning and conducted extensive simulations totaling over 2,200 games to analyze agent performance against various opponents. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial search techniques across different game complexities, from simple deterministic games to complex mathematical challenges. The results show that minimax algorithms achieve excellent performance in Tic-Tac-Toe (97.5\% win rate vs random), perfect performance in Connect4 (100\% win rate vs random), strategic patterns in the Halving Game with initial-number-dependent outcomes (0-100\% win rate range), and perfect play in Nim (100\% win rate vs random) using nim-sum mathematical heuristics. This study provides insights into computational decision-making and demonstrates the scalability of search algorithms across different game domains, with computational efficiency ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 moves per game.

\section{Introduction}

Strategic games provide an excellent framework for exploring adversarial decision-making under deterministic conditions. In this comprehensive project, we selected four distinct games: \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}, \textbf{Connect4}, the \textbf{Halving Game}, and \textbf{Nim}, each representing different levels of complexity and strategic depth. Our objective was to investigate how computational agents leveraging advanced search algorithms perform across various game domains and opponent types.

The selection of these four games was strategic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}: A simple, well-understood game that allows for complete game tree exploration
    \item \textbf{Connect4}: A medium-complexity game with practical applications and interesting strategic elements
    \item \textbf{Halving Game}: A mathematical game that demonstrates the application of search algorithms to non-traditional game domains
    \item \textbf{Nim}: A classic impartial game with well-established mathematical theory and optimal strategies
\end{itemize}

This report is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the four games and their mathematical properties. Section 3 details the implementation of game engines and search algorithms. Section 4 outlines the experimental design and simulation methodology. Section 5 presents comprehensive results and data visualizations. Section 6 discusses the implications and comparative analysis. Section 7 concludes with reflections and future directions.
\section{Game Descriptions}

\subsection{Tic-Tac-Toe}

\textbf{Overview.}  
Tic-Tac-Toe is a deterministic, finite, two-player, zero-sum game with perfect information, played on a $3\times3$ grid. Players X and O alternate placing their mark in an empty cell; the game ends immediately when one player aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is filled, resulting in a draw.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{State-Space Complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There exists a total of $3^9 = 19\,683$ possible assignments of \{X, O, blank\}.
  \item  $5\,478$ positions exist that satisfy turn-order and early termination rules.
  \item Reducing for symmetry, there exists only $765$ distinct positions under the dihedral group $D_4$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Game-Tree Complexity:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There exists $9! = 362\,880$ possible move sequences if play continues until the board is full.
  \item However, there exist only $\approx255\,168$ paths when pruning sequences that end early with a win.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Algorithmic Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Back-propagate minimax values on all $5\,478$ reachable states in $O(N)$ time and space, where $N=5\,478$.
  \item Applying minimax with alpha-beta pruning provides worst-case $O(b^d)$ time ($b\le9$), with typical ~50\% pruning on balanced trees.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Optimal Play.}  
Under perfect play from both sides, Tic-Tac-Toe is a forced draw. The strongest opening move is the center (4 potential win-lines), followed by any corner (3 lines); edge openings (2 lines) are strictly weaker.

\subsection{Connect 4}

\textbf{Overview.}  
Connect 4 is a deterministic, finite, two-player, zero-sum game with perfect information. It is played on a $7\times6$ vertical grid where players take turns dropping colored discs into one of seven columns. Due to gravity, each disc falls to the lowest available position in the selected column. A player wins by aligning four of their discs consecutively in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The game ends immediately upon a win or when the board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{State-Space Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The estimated total number of distinct board configurations is approximately $4.5 \times 10^{12}$.
  \item All legal positions must satisfy the gravity constraint, meaning no disc can be placed above an empty cell.
  \item Horizontal symmetry reduces the number of unique positions that must be evaluated during tree search.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Game-Tree Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The maximum length of a game is 42 moves, corresponding to one disc in each of the 42 board cells. This gives a naive upper bound of $7^{42} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{35}$ raw move sequences.
  \item The effective branching factor starts near 7 but decreases as columns fill. Terminal conditions and forced wins introduce early cutoffs in practice.
  \item Connect 4 has been strongly solved, and the first player can always force a win with perfect play.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Algorithmic Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Alpha-beta pruning is used to search the minimax game tree efficiently. Well-ordered move sequences enable pruning that reduces the search space from $O(b^d)$ to approximately $O(b^{d/2})$ in realistic cases.
  \item Central columns are prioritized in search order, as they contribute to the most potential winning lines and improve pruning performance.
  \item The game board can be encoded using two 64-bit integers (one for each player), which allows constant-time move generation and win checking. This bitboard representation is optimized for implementation in low-level languages.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Optimal Play.}  
Due to the size of the state space, a full enumeration of all positions is not feasible in practice. However, bots that search to depth 8-9 using alpha-beta pruning with basic heuristics (center prioritization, win detection, and threat evaluation) are capable of consistently defeating human players. With optimized C or C++ implementations, these depths are reachable in milliseconds, making the bot effectively unbeatable.

\subsection{Halving Game}

\textbf{Overview.}  
The Halving Game is a deterministic, finite, two-player, zero-sum game with perfect information. Play starts from an integer $N>1$. On each turn, a player must either subtract one ($N\to N-1$) or halve via integer division ($N\to\lfloor N/2\rfloor$). The game ends when $N=1$, and the player making that move wins.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{State-Space Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The set of possible states is exactly $\{1,2,\dots,N\}$, so there are $N$ distinct positions.
  \item Every non-terminal state $n>1$ has up to two successors, $n-1$ and $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$.
  \item All moves strictly decrease $n$, ensuring the state graph is acyclic and finite.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Game-Tree Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The maximum branching factor is 2, since you can either subtract or halve.
  \item The depth of any play path is between $\lfloor\log_2 N\rfloor$ (all halvings) and $N-1$ (all subtractions).
  \item Because each integer appears at most once per path, the total number of nodes in the game tree is $O(N)$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Algorithmic Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Label each state $1\le n\le N$ as winning or losing via bottomâ€‘up DP.
  \item Initialize $dp[1]=\text{losing}$. For $n>1$, set $dp[n]=\text{winning}$ if either $dp[n-1]$ or $dp[\lfloor n/2\rfloor]$ is losing, else $dp[n]=\text{losing}$.
  \item This runs in $O(N)$ time and uses $O(N)$ space.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Optimal Play.}  
All odd $n>1$ are winning positions, because at least one of $n-1$ or $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ is losing. Even $n$ is losing exactly when $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ is winning. In practice you precompute the $dp$ array in linear time and then each move is chosen in $O(1)$ by picking a successor classified as losing.

\subsection{Nim Game}

\textbf{Introduction.}  
Nim is a deterministic, finite, two-player, zero-sum game with perfect information. The game begins with $p$ piles containing $n_1,n_2,\dots,n_p$ stones. Players alternate turns removing one or more stones from exactly one pile. The player who takes the last stone wins.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{State-Space Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The total number of distinct positions is $\prod_{i=1}^{p}(n_i+1)$, since each pile can hold between 0 and $n_i$ stones.
  \item Every move strictly decreases the total stone count, ensuring the state graph is finite and acyclic.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Game-Tree Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
  \item At a position with pile sizes $n_i$, the branching factor is $\sum_{i=1}^p n_i$, because a player may remove any positive number of stones from any nonempty pile.
  \item The maximum depth of a play sequence is $\sum_{i=1}^p n_i$, which occurs when exactly one stone is removed per turn.
  \item The total number of play sequences is bounded by $O(b^d)$ with $b\le \sum_i n_i$ and $d\le \sum_i n_i$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Algorithmic Solution}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute the nim-sum $S = n_1 \oplus n_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus n_p$ in $O(p)$ time.
  \item Classify any position with $S=0$ as losing and with $S\neq 0$ as winning.
  \item From a winning position, choose a pile $i$ such that $n_i \oplus S < n_i$ and remove $n_i - (n_i \oplus S)$ stones to force the resulting nim-sum to zero.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Optimal Play.}  
A player has a winning strategy precisely when the nim-sum of the pile sizes is nonzero on their turn. By always moving to a zero nim-sum position, that player guarantees a win under perfect play. If the nim-sum is zero at the start of a turn, any move will hand a nonzero nim-sum to the opponent, resulting in a forced loss.

\section{Agent Design and Implementation}

\subsection{Search Algorithms}

We implemented advanced search algorithms across all four games, with optimizations tailored to each game's specific characteristics.

\subsubsection{Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning}

The core algorithm used across all games is minimax search enhanced with alpha-beta pruning. The recursive formulation is:

\[
\text{Minimax}(s) =
\begin{cases}
U(s), & \text{if } s \text{ is terminal} \\
\max_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MAX} \\
\min_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MIN}
\end{cases}
\]

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation}

\textbf{Engine Overview.}  
The game logic and Agent are implemented in pure Python using a nestedâ€‘list board representation and a minimax algorithm with alphaâ€“beta pruning. Key components are summarized below:

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a 3Ã—3 nested list initialized to \texttt{EMPTY} (0).  
  \item Define constants \texttt{PLAYER\_X = 1}, \texttt{PLAYER\_O = 2}, and \texttt{DRAW = 3}.  
  \item Track move count \texttt{cnt} and current player via \texttt{self.player}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Win Detection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Check each of the three rows and three columns for three identical nonâ€‘\texttt{EMPTY} markers.  
  \item Check main and antiâ€‘diagonals the same way.  
  \item Declare \texttt{game\_over} and set \texttt{winner} accordingly, or detect draw when no \texttt{EMPTY} cells remain.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Evaluation Function}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Return \texttt{+10} if X has three in a row, \texttt{-10} if O does, or \texttt{0} otherwise.  
  \item Incorporate depth into terminal scores to prefer faster wins and slower losses:
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{score = base +/- depth}.
    \end{center}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Minimax Search with \(\alpha\)-\(\beta\) Pruning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recursively evaluate all available moves up to terminal states.  
  \item For maximizing (X), choose the move with highest minimax value; for minimizing (O), choose lowest.  
  \item Prune branches when \texttt{alpha >= beta}.  
  \item Use inâ€‘place board updates with backtracking: set cell, recurse, then reset cell.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Move Selection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item On Agent turn, special case: if \texttt{cnt == 0} and center is empty, pick (1,1).  
  \item Otherwise, iterate through all \texttt{EMPTY} cells, call minimax, and choose the optimal move based on player.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{print\_board()} displays row/column indices and current markers.  
  \item \texttt{get\_user\_move()} prompts until a valid row/col is entered.  
  \item \texttt{play\_game()} loops human (X) vs Agent (O) turns until \texttt{game\_over}.  
  \item \texttt{play\_agent\_vs\_agent()} simulates two agents for testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Connect 4 Implementation}

\textbf{Engine Overview.}  
The core search engine is implemented in Cython and exposed via a single Python entry point. Key components are summarized below:

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Precompute 64â€‘bit bitboard masks for each column: \texttt{BOTTOM\_MASK}, \texttt{BOARD\_MASK}, and \texttt{TOP\_MASK}.
  \item Define an ordered column list \texttt{ORDER = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 6]} to prioritize central moves.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Win Detection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Detect four rows in one expression:
  \begin{center}
  \texttt{win = ((bb \& (bb >> shift) \& (bb >> (2 * shift))) != 0)} for \\ \texttt{shift} \,$\in$ {\texttt{BITS, BITS + 1, BITS - 1, 1}}.
  \end{center}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Evaluation Function}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute occupancy mask: \texttt{occ = cur | opp}.
  \item Apply center bonus: \texttt{score += 3 * popcount(cur \& BOARD\_MASK[3])}.
  \item For each precomputed line mask, count bits via \texttt{popcount}, then:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Add 100 for four in a row.
      \item Add 5 for an open three.
      \item Add 2 for a neutral two.
      \item Subtract 4 for opponent open three.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Negamax Search with \(\alpha\)-\(\beta\) Pruning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recurse with a single inline call:
        \begin{center}
        \texttt{score = -nega(opp, cur\_next, depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)}, \\ breaking when
        \texttt{alpha >= beta}.
        \end{center}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Move Selection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Iterate \texttt{col} in \texttt{ORDER}, skip if full via \texttt{if occ \& TOP\_MASK[col]}, compute successor and score, then track the maximum.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Python Wrapper}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Method \texttt{best\_move(depth)} loads \texttt{cur} and \texttt{opp} bitboards, then returns \texttt{find\_best(cur, opp, depth)}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Halving Game Implementation}

\textbf{Engine Overview.}  
The game logic and Agent are implemented in pure Python using integer state transitions and a minimax algorithm with alphaâ€“beta pruning. Key components are summarized below:

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Store starting number in \texttt{self.initial\_number} and set current state to this value.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Move Generation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{get\_moves(n)} returns up to two successors: 
  \begin{center}
      \texttt{n - 1} and \texttt{n // 2} when \texttt{n > 1}.
  \end{center}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Minimax Search with \(\alpha\)-\(\beta\) Pruning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recursively call
    \begin{center}
        \texttt{(value, move) = minimax(state, is\_maximizing, depth, alpha, beta)}.
    \end{center}
  \item Base case: when \texttt{state == 1}, return \texttt{(+1, None)} if minimizing (previous wins) or \texttt{(-1, None)} if maximizing.
  \item Maximizing branch updates \texttt{best\_value = max(best\_value, value)} and prunes when \texttt{alpha >= beta}.
  \item Minimizing branch tracks \texttt{best\_value = min(best\_value, value)} with symmetric pruning.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Game Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In \texttt{play\_game()}, loop while state is greater than 1, call
  \begin{center}
      \texttt{minimax(current, current\_player == 1)},
  \end{center} unpack move, print operation "-1" or "/2", update state, then swap player IDs.
  \item Determine final winner by inverting the last mover.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nim Game Implementation}

\noindent\textbf{Engine Overview.}  
The Nim game engine is written in pure Python, combining a mathematical nim-sum heuristic with a fallback minimax search using alphaâ€“beta pruning. Game state, performance metrics, and move history are all tracked in a simple class.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textbf{Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Copy the provided list of pile sizes into \texttt{self.piles}.  
  \item Initialize \texttt{self.visited\_nodes} to zero and \texttt{self.move\_history} to an empty list for performance tracking.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Move Generation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{generate\_moves()} returns all legal \texttt{(pile\_idx, stones)} pairs by iterating each pile and all valid removal counts from 1 up to the pileâ€™s size.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Nimâ€‘Sum Heuristic}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute \texttt{nim\_sum = piles[0] \textasciicircum piles[1] \dots \textasciicircum piles[p-1]} in $O(p)$ time.
  \item If \texttt{nim\_sum == 0}, the position is losing; otherwise, \texttt{optimal\_nim\_move()} finds a pile and removal count that yields zero nim-sum in one line.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Minimax Search with \(\alpha\)-\(\beta\) Pruning and Depth Limit}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increment \texttt{self.visited\_nodes} on each recursive call to \texttt{minimax()}.
  \item Terminal check via \texttt{is\_game\_over()} returns $+1$ if the previous mover won, else $-1$.
  \item At depth zero, evaluate via nim-sum: return $+1$ for nonzero nim-sum (winning) or $-1$ for zero nim-sum (losing).
  \item Maximizing branch selects the maximum child value, updates \texttt{alpha}, and breaks when \texttt{alpha >= beta}; minimizing is analogous with \texttt{beta}.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Move Selection}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{find\_best\_move(depth,use\_nim\_sum)} first attempts the constantâ€‘time nim-sum strategy if enabled; if that fails or is disabled, it iterates over all moves and calls \texttt{minimax()} to pick the optimal move, returning the move and nodes evaluated.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Simulation and Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{simulate\_game(...)} loops until all piles are empty, chooses moves per agent policy ("nim_sum", "minimax", or "random"), logs each move and accumulates node count.
  \item Batch functions \texttt{run\_simulation\_batch()} and \texttt{analyze\_depth\_performance()} run multiple games, gathering statistics on win rates, average game length, node usage, and time per game.
  \item \texttt{comprehensive\_nim\_analysis()} combines basic performance, searchâ€‘depth experiments, varied initial configurations, and agentâ€‘type comparisons, then saves results to JSON.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Design and Methodology}

\subsection{Simulation Framework}

We developed a comprehensive simulation framework to test agent performance across different scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Random}: Testing algorithm against random moves
\item \textbf{Agent vs Agent}: Comparing the effectiveness of different search depths and strategies
    \item \textbf{Performance Analysis}: Measuring computational efficiency
    \item \textbf{Strategy Analysis}: Determining optimal moves
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection}

For each type of game, we collected the win rates, average game length, computational time per move, strategy patterns and performance with search depth.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

For our analysis, we collected sufficient data to ensure reliable results. We used a minimum of 50 games per configuration for statistical significance and applied multiple runs on different devices to ensure variance. 

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Tic-Tac-Toe Results}

Our Tic-Tac-Toe implementation achieved excellent performance based on actual simulation results (200 games per scenario):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Random}: 97.5\% win rate, 2.5\% draw rate, 0\% loss rate
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Agent}: 0\% win rate, 100\% draw rate, 0\% loss rate (perfect play)
    \item \textbf{Random vs Random}: 56.5\% win rate, 15.5\% draw rate, 28\% loss rate
\end{itemize}
When both players use optimal minimax strategy, the game always results in a draw, confirming theoretical predictions. Average game lengths: 5.7 moves (vs random), 9.0 moves (vs agent), 7.7 moves (random vs random).

\caption{Tic-Tac-Toe Agent performance against different opponent types}
\label{fig:ttt_win_rates}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Connect4 Results}

Connect4 showed exceptional performance based on actual simulation results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Random}: 100\% win rate (depth 8) - perfect performance
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Agent (8 vs 6)}: Depth 8 agent won 100\% of games against depth 6
    \item \textbf{Agent vs Agent (equal depth)}: Results in balanced strategic play
    \item \textbf{Average game length}: 11.0 moves (vs random), 35.2 moves (vs depth 6 agent)
    \item \textbf{Computation time}: 0.007 seconds per move at depth 8
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Search Depth Analysis:}
The search depth in Connect4 represents how many moves ahead the Agent can analyze. This is crucial because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth 6}: Agent can see 6 moves ahead, sufficient for basic tactical play
    \item \textbf{Depth 8}: Agent can see 8 moves ahead, enabling complex strategic planning
    \item \textbf{8 vs 6 advantage}: The deeper Agent can identify threats and opportunities that the shallower Agent cannot see
    \item \textbf{8 vs 8 equilibrium}: When both agents have equal depth, the game becomes a test of opening strategy and move ordering
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Computational Impact:}
Based on actual simulation results, computation time scales with search depth:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth 2}: 0.000 seconds per move, 100\% win rate vs random
    \item \textbf{Depth 4}: 0.000 seconds per move, 100\% win rate vs random
    \item \textbf{Depth 6}: 0.001 seconds per move, 100\% win rate vs random
    \item \textbf{Depth 8}: 0.007 seconds per move, 100\% win rate vs random
    \item \textbf{Performance insight}: All depths achieve perfect performance vs random players
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Halving Game Results}

The Halving Game revealed interesting mathematical patterns based on actual simulation results (100 games per initial number):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number 10}: 0\% win rate, 4.0 average moves (losing position)
    \item \textbf{Number 15}: 100\% win rate, 7.0 average moves (winning position)
    \item \textbf{Number 20}: 100\% win rate, 5.0 average moves (winning position)
    \item \textbf{Number 25}: 100\% win rate, 9.0 average moves (winning position)
    \item \textbf{Number 30}: 0\% win rate, 8.0 average moves (losing position)
    \item \textbf{Number 50}: 0\% win rate, 10.0 average moves (losing position)
\end{itemize}
The results demonstrate that optimal play in the Halving Game is highly dependent on the mathematical properties of the initial number, with clear patterns emerging between winning and losing positions.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Nim Game Results}

The Nim game is a \textbf{completely solved mathematical game} where the outcome is determined by the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nim-sum = 0}: Current player is in a losing position
    \item \textbf{Nim-sum $\neq$ 0}: Current player can force a win with optimal play
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Proof of Optimal Strategy:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If Nim-sum = 0, any move will result in a non-zero Nim-sum (losing position)
    \item If Nim-sum $\neq$ 0, there exists a move that makes the resulting Nim-sum = 0
    \item The player who makes the last move (reduces all piles to 0) wins
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Configuration-Specific Win Rates (Actual Simulation Results):}
