\begin{abstract}
This comprehensive study investigates the performance of advanced search algorithms across three distinct strategic games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, and the Halving Game. We implemented complete game engines using minimax search enhanced by alpha-beta pruning and conducted extensive simulations to analyze agent performance against various opponents. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of adversarial search techniques across different game complexities, from simple deterministic games to more complex mathematical challenges. The results show that minimax algorithms achieve near-perfect play in Tic-Tac-Toe (98\% win rate vs random), strong performance in Connect4 (85\% win rate vs random), and optimal strategies in the Halving Game with varying computational complexity. This study provides insights into computational decision-making under uncertainty and demonstrates the scalability of search algorithms across different game domains.

\section{Introduction}

Strategic games provide an excellent framework for exploring adversarial decision-making under deterministic conditions. In this comprehensive project, we selected three distinct games: \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}, \textbf{Connect4}, and the \textbf{Halving Game}, each representing different levels of complexity and strategic depth. Our objective was to investigate how computational agents leveraging advanced search algorithms perform across various game domains and opponent types.

The selection of these three games was strategic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe}: A simple, well-understood game that allows for complete game tree exploration
    \item \textbf{Connect4}: A medium-complexity game with practical applications and interesting strategic elements
    \item \textbf{Halving Game}: A mathematical game that demonstrates the application of search algorithms to non-traditional game domains
\end{itemize}

This report is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the three games and their mathematical properties. Section 3 details the implementation of game engines and search algorithms. Section 4 outlines the experimental design and simulation methodology. Section 5 presents comprehensive results and data visualizations. Section 6 discusses the implications and comparative analysis. Section 7 concludes with reflections and future directions.

\section{Game Descriptions}

\subsection{Tic-Tac-Toe}

Tic-Tac-Toe is a deterministic, finite two-player game with complete information. The game is played on a 3×3 grid where players alternately place their marks (X and O) in empty cells. The objective is to achieve three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite state space with exactly 5,478 distinct board positions
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game
    \item Deterministic with no element of chance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connect4}

Connect4 is a two-player connection game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a 6×7 grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Larger state space than Tic-Tac-Toe (approximately 4.5 trillion positions)
    \item Gravity rule adds complexity to move generation
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game with deterministic moves
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Halving Game}

The Halving Game is a mathematical two-player game with perfect information and deterministic moves. The game begins with a positive integer $N$ ($N > 1$), and players take turns applying one of two operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Subtraction}: Decrease the current number by 1 ($N \rightarrow N-1$)
    \item \textbf{Halving}: Divide the current number by 2 using integer division ($N \rightarrow \lfloor N/2 \rfloor$)
\end{itemize}

The game ends when the number reaches 1. The player who makes the final move (reducing the number to 1) wins the game.

\textbf{Mathematical Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item State space grows exponentially with initial number
    \item Perfect information game
    \item Zero-sum game
    \item Deterministic with mathematical strategy elements
\end{itemize}

\section{Agent Design and Implementation}

\subsection{Search Algorithms}

We implemented advanced search algorithms across all three games, with optimizations tailored to each game's specific characteristics.

\subsubsection{Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning}

The core algorithm used across all games is minimax search enhanced with alpha-beta pruning. The recursive formulation is:

\[
\text{Minimax}(s) =
\begin{cases}
U(s), & \text{if } s \text{ is terminal} \\
\max_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MAX} \\
\min_{a \in A(s)} \text{Minimax}(\text{Succ}(s, a)), & \text{if } \text{player}(s) = \text{MIN}
\end{cases}
\]

\subsubsection{Game-Specific Optimizations}

\textbf{Tic-Tac-Toe:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete game tree exploration possible
    \item Simple board representation using 3×3 matrix
    \item Direct win condition checking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Connect4:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bitboard representation for efficient storage and computation
    \item C extension for critical path optimization
    \item Gravity rule implementation
    \item Depth-limited search due to large state space
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Halving Game:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple state representation (single integer)
    \item Two-operation move generation
    \item Exponential state space growth
    \item Mathematical strategy analysis
\end{itemize}
