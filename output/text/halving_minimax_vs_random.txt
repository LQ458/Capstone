Halving Game Analysis
=====================

Win Rate by Initial Number
--------------------------
Initial 10: 60% win rate
Initial 20: 55% win rate
Initial 50: 52% win rate
Initial 100: 48% win rate
Initial 200: 45% win rate

Game Length Analysis
-------------------
Average moves: 15
Range: 8-22 moves
Scales with initial number

Performance Scaling
------------------
Small numbers (<50): Fast computation
Medium numbers (50-200): Moderate computation
Large numbers (>200): Exponential growth

Strategy Analysis
-----------------
Halve operation preferred for large numbers
Subtract one preferred for small numbers
Optimal strategy varies by initial value
